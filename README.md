## ‚ùì What is Alacritty?

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that emphasizes performance, simplicity, and GPU acceleration. Written in Rust and using OpenGL, it provides fast and responsive terminal rendering even under heavy workloads.

Designed to be minimal but powerful, Alacritty does not include tabs or UI frills ‚Äî instead, it relies on external tools like tmux or Windows Terminal for multiplexer functionality. Configuration is done through a straightforward YAML file, giving users full control over appearance, fonts, key bindings, padding, and more.

With true color support, ligatures, and retina scaling, Alacritty is ideal for developers, sysadmins, and power users who want a lean and fast terminal without compromise.
